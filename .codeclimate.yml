# Engines can analyze files and report issues on them, but you can separately
# decide which files will receive ratings based on those issues. This is
# specified by path patterns under the ratings key.

# For more details see here:

# Note: If the ratings key is not specified, this will result in a 0.0 GPA on your dashboard.
